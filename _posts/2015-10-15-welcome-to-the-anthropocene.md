Welcome to Designing the Anthropocene - Creating a future as if humans matter. As Stewart Brand said years ago, "We are as gods, as might as well get good at it." The question becomes what sort of gods will we be? We have the opportunity to build a world that provides more wealth, health, happiness and sustainability than any time in our history. Will we take up the challenge? Or will we allow our current ways of organizing our economy and politics to take us down the road we are already on.

This site will be a repository of useful links, inspiration and general scrapbooking as we explore the possible future together.
